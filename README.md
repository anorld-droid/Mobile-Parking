# Mobile-Parking
This project offers an android reservation system where users can view various parking areas and select a space to view whether it is available or not. If the booking space is available then he can book it for specific time slot. The booked space will be marked occupied and will not be available for anyone else for the specified time. This system provides several additional features including canceling the bookings, a user can cancel their booked space anytime. Users can also make payment via M-pesa, what will be required for them to do is click a pay button and an M-pesa STK-Push appears asking them to enter their M-pesa pin, having registered their M-pesa number during registration phase, billing will be generated automatically. After making payment users are notified about the booking via a push notification along with unique parking number and generated QR-Code, shown to municipal council or at the entrance of the parking area for private parking spaces. Users can also view their previous bookings and rebook if it is available. In addition, the mobile application will have an administrator side who can revoke a booking space, generate and view a report of payment history of the parking areas and also a download it. Finally, it will allow users to get directions to the booked parking slot using GPS Maps integrated to the application.
